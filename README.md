# Bible-Trivia-App
A simple Bible trivia application that accepts questions from users through a Google Form (which are imported through SQLLite). 

The purpose of this project is to show the code for this game.  To find the two c# scripts go into the Assets > Scripts folder.  I have decided to post this entire project (instead of just the C# code, as I did for my other Unity projects) because it is small and all of the scripts and plugins I used are either open-source or completely my own.
